prototype lvl work, readme may be wrong
no sanity checks, sim trusts players to make legal moves


each team has a base
warriors spawn from the base
warriors can attack enemy bases
warriors can attack other warriors
warriors attack a target by attempting to occupy the same space as it
all warriors occupying the same space will die except one (chosen at random)
a game will end when there is only one teams base
 or one teams warriors alive
each team will have a fixed # of warriors spawned from their
 base
warriors spawn over the base (keep other warriors clear)

a game has the following attrs:
 board size
 # of teams (private)
 # of warriors (per team)
 length of game (in ticks)
 base positions (private)
 random seed

the simulation will give each player 1 second
 to make it's moves known during a round

ticks go as follows:
 announce round start
 gather player input
 make warrior moves
 opposing warriors in same space die
 warriors do battle
 warriors die from battle
 warriors left alive possible do battle with base
 dead players are notified and dropped from game
 (maybe) new warriors are spawned from bases

each round players will be given the following information:
 location of players warriors
 location of observable warriors from opposing teams
 location of observable bases from opposing teams
 warriors which died in the last round
